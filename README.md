## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` for package management
- A Stripe account
- A Telegram bot token
- Twilio account for WhatsApp

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Codex-zero-source/JollofAI
cd JollofAI
```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```env
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
    LLM_API_KEY="your_llm_api_key"
    BASE_URL="your_llm_base_url"
    KITCHEN_CHAT_ID="your_kitchen_chat_id"
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your_stripe_webhook_secret"
    TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_twilio_account_sid"
    TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_twilio_auth_token"
    TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER="your_twilio_whatsapp_number"
    ```

### Running the App

1.  **Initialize the database:**

    The database is initialized automatically when the app starts.

2.  **Run the Flask app:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

3.  **Run the Payment Watcher (in a separate terminal):**

    The payment watcher is a separate service that monitors the blockchain for incoming crypto payments.

    ```bash
    python payment_watcher.py
    ```

4.  **Set up webhooks:**

    -   **Telegram:** You'll need to set up a webhook to point to your server's `/webhook` endpoint. You can use a tool like `ngrok` for local development.

        ```bash
        curl -F "url=https://your-domain.com/webhook" https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
        ```

    -   **Twilio (WhatsApp):** Configure the webhook URL in your Twilio dashboard to point to `/twilio_webhook`.

## ðŸª™ Crypto Payments (USDT on Fuji Testnet)

Set the following environment variables (see `env.example`):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FUJI_RPC_URL` | The RPC URL for the Fuji testnet. |
| `USDT_TOKEN_ADDRESS` | The contract address for the USDT token on the Fuji testnet. |

Flow:
1. After order confirmation bot asks **Card / Crypto**.
2. If **Crypto** selected it generates a new wallet and replies with the USDT amount & address (Fuji Testnet).
3. The system then waits for the payment to be confirmed on the blockchain.
4. A webhook at `/payment_webhook` is used to verify the payment. Once verified, the order is marked as paid, and the user and kitchen are notified.

> For production, you would switch to a mainnet RPC URL and a USDT token address on that mainnet. You would also need to update your webhook URL to a production URL.
